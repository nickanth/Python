Hey therer 
Here is a little number guess game. Just for fun and for practice. 
Enjoy!! // Nick




#code


import random
import sys
import os



global counter

counter = 1

global x
global y


#a self made random_number generator 
x = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];
z = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10];





t = random.choice(z);
y = random.choice(x);

number_ = t + y


#this is out of the loop, so it is displayed just one time.
def intro_guess():
    print("The number is between 2-20");
    number_guess()

#main code
def number_guess():
    global counter
    

    guess = int(input("Guess the number"));

    if guess == number_:
            print("That is the number");
            print(number_);
            print("Du hast",counter,"Versuche benÃ¶tigt um die Zahl zufinden.");


    if guess < number_:
            print("Guess higher");
            counter = counter + 1
            number_guess()
    if guess > number_:
            print("Guess lower");
            counter = counter + 1
            number_guess()



intro_guess();
